# Introduction

The IR manager needs to import 201 dissertations into DSpace from the following quarters

- 2015.08 Summer
- 2015.12 Autumn
- 2016.03 Winter
- 2016.06 Spring

The 201 dissertations that need to be imported will have the Creative Commons license in the following XML element from the XML metadata that comes with every disseration

- DISS_creative_commons_license
    - DISS_abbreviation

In order to successfully import each disseration into DSpace they must conform to Simple Archive Format (SAF) which is described in the DSpace documentation page [here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC5x/Importing+and+Exporting+Items+via+Simple+Archive+Format)

There is a tool available for creating SAF items available at [SAFBuilder Github page](https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/SAFBuilder)
